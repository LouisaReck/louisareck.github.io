        We conducted a summative evaluation with four different users to find
        out if our design met the user tasks. We tested our prototype and
        collected data in a controlled environment involving the user. The
        testing was divided into two parts; a usability test and a post-task
        questionnaire. Our main goal for the testing was to measure the
        efficiency and effectiveness of the application, but also the overall
        satisfaction of using it.
        <br /> <br />
        In the final analysis, we drew the paths taken for each user task
        performed by each user. The drawings gave us great insight into where
        and what we could improve in our prototype.
